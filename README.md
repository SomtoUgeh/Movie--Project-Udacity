Movie Website

This is a python project on Udacity for my Nanodegree, It is on **Foundations of python.** 
There are 3 Files present in this Folder.
1. Entertain.py
2. Movie.py

**Entertain.py** is a file that contains instances of the movie we love.

**Movie.py** is a file containing the class "Media". It is an important part to the intergration of the program. 

**Fresh_tomatoes.py** contains the HTML and Integral part of the program. it was forked from Github repo accessed on the nanodegree platform. 

Proper documentation to the code is in the python files.
